### COMPONENTS

### Decentralized Identity (DI)

- **Core Components:** Identity data (name, date of birth, address, etc.), public key, private key, and associated credentials.
- **Data Storage:** Distributed storage solution (IPFS, P2P, or blockchain-based storage) for data redundancy and security.
- **Identity Wallet:** A user-friendly interface for managing identity data and credentials.

### Decentralized Domain (DD)

- **Domain Registration:** Integration with a decentralized domain registry (Unstoppable Domains or similar).
- **Domain Resolution:** Mapping the decentralized domain to the user's identity.
- **Ownership Verification:** Ensuring secure ownership of the domain.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability (Wormhole)

- **Message Passing:** Facilitating secure and reliable communication between Ethereum and Solana for initial tests.
- **Asset Transfer:** Enabling the transfer of tokens or other assets between chains.
- **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring consistency of identity data across different blockchains.

### Blockchains (Ethereum, Solana)

- **Smart Contracts:** Deploying contracts for identity management, credential issuance, and verification.
- **Tokenization:** Potential use of tokens for identity verification or access control.
- **Security:** Implementing robust security measures (e.g., multi-sig wallets, access controls).

### Credential Management

- **Credential Standards:** Adhering to industry standards (W3C Verifiable Credentials, etc.).
- **Issuance and Verification:** Processes for issuing, storing, and verifying credentials.
- **Revocation:** Mechanism for revoking compromised credentials.

### Identity Provider (IDP)

- **Role:** Manages identity creation, updates, and verification.
- **Interactions:** Interact with the user, decentralized domain registry, and blockchain.

### Verifier (VR)

- **Role:** Validate identity and credentials.
- **Interactions:** Interact with the user, identity provider, and blockchain.
